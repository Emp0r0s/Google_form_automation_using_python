# Google_form_automation_using_python

Clone this git repo and run this script to try out.

Filing Google Forms daily is a boring task and most of the time i forget to fill up the form. This is a basic Python script which fill up the form and submit it automatically. And with the help of Cron (Linux) or Task Scheduler (Windows), the script can be scheduled to run periodically. This is a basic script where i used input function but variables can be used for fixed inputs and many complex things can be added signing in google account and then submitting, setting env variables etc.
